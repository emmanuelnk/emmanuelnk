Hi there! 👋🏿

I'm Emmanuel Nsubuga Kyeyune 🇺🇬  -- front/back-end software engineer and solutions architect. Currently involved in the design and maintenance of APIs and cloud based applications.


📍&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beijing, China  
👨🏿‍🎓&nbsp;&nbsp;M.Eng Communications And Information Systems

## 🐻 What I care about

I'm love problem solving and advancing technology in ways that make our lives simpler. From using five 3.5 💾floppy disks to install Encarta as a bored six year old till today, my curiosity for learning new things has never waned. 

I'm usually wired in at night when I can realize bursts of creativity and focus while listening to 🎧hip-hop. When I'm not coding you can catch me watching artsy-fartsy/indie 🎞️films or prestige 📺TV shows.
